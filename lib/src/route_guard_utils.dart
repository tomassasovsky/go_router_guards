/// A guard that can be applied globally to all routes with inclusion and
/// exclusion capabilities.
///
/// This class wraps another guard and provides functionality to include or
/// exclude specific routes or route patterns from guard execution.
///
/// ## Usage Recommendations
///
/// **Start Simple**: Most use cases need only inclusion OR exclusion, not both.
///
/// **Pure Inclusion** (recommended for targeted protection):
/// ```dart
/// ConditionalGuard(
///   guard: AuthGuard(),
///   includedPatterns: [RegExp(r'^/user/.*')], // Only user routes
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Pure Exclusion** (recommended for global protection with exceptions):
/// ```dart
/// ConditionalGuard(
///   guard: AuthGuard(),
///   excludedPaths: ['/login', '/register'], // Everywhere except these
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Mixed Rules** (advanced use cases only):
/// Use when you need to apply guards to a pattern but exclude specific routes
/// within that pattern.
/// ```dart
/// ConditionalGuard(
///   guard: AdminGuard(),
///   includedPatterns: [RegExp(r'^/admin/.*')], // All admin routes
///   excludedPaths: ['/admin/status'], // Except public monitoring
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Inclusion vs Exclusion Logic
/// - If `includedPaths` or `includedPatterns` are provided, the guard will
/// ONLY apply to matching routes
/// - If `excludedPaths` or `excludedPatterns` are provided, the guard will
/// apply to all routes EXCEPT matching ones
/// - If both inclusion and exclusion rules are provided, exclusion takes
/// precedence (excluded routes will never have the guard applied)
/// - If no inclusion rules are provided, the guard applies to all routes
/// (global behavior)
///
/// ## Alternative Approaches
///
/// Consider these alternatives before using mixed rules:
/// - **Multiple Guards**: Apply different guards to different route patterns
/// - **Custom Guard Logic**: Write a guard that handles complex logic
/// internally
/// - **Route Restructuring**: Organize routes so simpler patterns work
///
class ConditionalGuard extends RouteGuard {
  /// Creates a conditional guard with the specified inclusion and exclusion
  /// rules.
  ///
  /// [guard] - The underlying guard to execute when conditions are met
  /// [includedPaths] - Exact paths where the guard should apply (if empty,
  /// applies to all paths)
  /// [includedPatterns] - Regular expression patterns for paths where the
  /// guard should apply
  /// [excludedPaths] - Exact paths to exclude from guard execution (takes
  /// precedence over inclusion)
