---

This page outlines the core building blocks you will use when protecting navigation with go_router_guards.

## RouteGuard

Guards encapsulate logic that decides whether navigation should continue, be redirected, or be blocked.

- Implement a guard by extending `RouteGuard` and overriding `onNavigation`.
- Use `resolver.next()`, `resolver.redirect('/path')`, or `resolver.block()`.

## NavigationResolver

The `NavigationResolver` mediates control flow between guards and the router, enabling middleware‑style composition.

## Guard composition

Compose multiple guards into one with helpers:

- `guardAll([...])` — all must pass
- `guardAnyOf([...], { fallbackRedirect })` — at least one must pass
- `guardOneOf([...], { fallbackRedirect })` — exactly one must pass

## Route mixins

For type‑safe routes, mix in `GuardedRoute` or `GuardedShellRoute` and provide a `guard`.

## ConditionalGuard

Target or exclude specific paths with `ConditionalGuard` while keeping logic in a single guard.
