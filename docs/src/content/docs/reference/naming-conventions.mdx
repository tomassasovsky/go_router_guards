title: Naming Conventions
description: Consistent names for guards, routes, and helpers
---

Adopt clear, intention‑revealing names to keep guard logic readable.

- Guard classes: `AuthGuard`, `RoleGuard`, `NetworkGuard`
- Composed guards: `authOrNetworkGuard = guardAnyOf([...])`
- Conditional guards: `ConditionalGuard(includePaths: ['/admin'])`
- Type‑safe routes: `ProfileRoute with GuardedRoute`
- Redirect helpers: `toRedirect()`

Prefer full words over abbreviations and align names with the behavior being enforced.
