## What are Route Guards?

Route Guards provide **middleware-style navigation protection** for your applications. Think of them as security checkpoints that can **allow**, **redirect**, or **block** navigation based on your custom logic.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="üõ°Ô∏è Middleware Pattern" icon="information">
    Clean, composable guards that intercept navigation attempts before they reach your screens.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üîß Framework Agnostic" icon="setting">
    Core guard logic works with any routing system. Framework-specific integrations provide seamless developer experience.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="‚ö° Composable Logic" icon="star">
    Combine simple guards into complex protection schemes with logical operators: AND, OR, XOR.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üéØ Precise Control" icon="approve-check">
    Fine-grained control over which routes are protected, with inclusion/exclusion patterns and conditional logic.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Core Concept

Every guard implements a simple middleware pattern:

```dart
class AuthGuard extends RouteGuard {
  @override
  FutureOr<void> onNavigation(
    NavigationResolver resolver,
    Object context,
    Object state,
  ) async {
    if (await isAuthenticated()) {
      resolver.next(); // ‚úÖ Allow navigation
    } else {
      resolver.redirect('/login'); // üîÄ Redirect to login
    }
  }
}
```

Guards receive a **resolver** that controls the navigation flow:
- `resolver.next()` - Allow navigation to continue
- `resolver.redirect('/path')` - Redirect to a different route  
- `resolver.block()` - Block navigation entirely

## Architecture

### route_guards

Framework-agnostic foundation providing:
- Base `RouteGuard` class
- `NavigationResolver` pattern
- Guard composition utilities
- **Works with any router**

### <span class="package-badge">Integration</span> Framework Packages

Specialized integrations for popular frameworks:
- **go_router_guards** - Flutter Go Router integration
- More integrations coming soon...

## Guard Composition

Combine guards to create sophisticated protection:

```dart
// All guards must pass (AND logic)
final adminGuard = Guards.all([
  AuthGuard(),
  RoleGuard(['admin']),
  PermissionGuard(['manage_users']),
]);

// Any guard can pass (OR logic)  
final accessGuard = Guards.anyOf([
  SubscriptionGuard(),
  StaffAccessGuard(),
  BetaTesterGuard(),
]);

// Exactly one guard must pass (XOR logic)
final exclusiveGuard = Guards.oneOf([
  DevelopmentModeGuard(),
  ProductionAccessGuard(),
]);
```

## Real-World Use Cases

## Framework Integration Example

Here's how it looks with Go Router integration:

```dart
// Type-safe route with guards
@TypedGoRoute<AdminRoute>(path: '/admin')
class AdminRoute extends GoRouteData with GuardedRoute {
  @override
  RouteGuard get guards => Guards.all([
    AuthGuard(),
    RoleGuard(['admin']),
  ]);
  
  @override
  Widget build(context, state) => AdminScreen();
}

// Traditional route with guards
GoRoute(
  path: '/admin',
  builder: (context, state) => AdminScreen(),
  redirect: RouteGuardUtils.createGuardRedirect(
    Guards.all([AuthGuard(), RoleGuard(['admin'])]),
  ),
)
```

## Key Benefits

- **üîí Security First**: Fail securely with proper error handling
- **üì¶ Reusable**: Write once, use everywhere
- **üß™ Testable**: Clean interfaces make testing straightforward  
- **‚ö° Performant**: Efficient execution with caching support
- **üõ†Ô∏è Developer Friendly**: Clear patterns and comprehensive documentation
- **üåê Production Ready**: Used in real applications with enterprise requirements
