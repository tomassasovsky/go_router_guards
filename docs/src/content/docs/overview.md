  <h1>Route Guards System</h1>
  <p>A flexible and extensible guard system that provides middleware-style navigation protection for modern applications.</p>
</div>

## What are Route Guards?

Route Guards is a powerful navigation protection system that provides a middleware-style approach to route protection. It allows you to create reusable guards that can authenticate, authorize, and control navigation flow throughout your application, regardless of the underlying routing framework.

## Key Features

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="üîê Route Protection" icon="lock">

  <Card title="üîß Type-Safe Integration" icon="puzzle">
    Full support for Go Router's type-safe routing with GuardedRoute and UnguardedRoute mixins.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="‚ö° Guard Combinations" icon="lightning">
    Combine multiple guards with Guards.all(), Guards.anyOf(), and Guards.oneOf() for complex protection scenarios.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üéØ Conditional Protection" icon="target">
    Apply guards with fine-grained control over which routes are affected using inclusion and exclusion patterns.

## Architecture

The Route Guards system consists of a core package and framework integrations:

### route_guards
The core, framework-agnostic package that provides:
- Base `RouteGuard` class for creating guards
- `NavigationResolver` for controlling navigation flow
- `Guards` utility for combining guards
- Guard composition and execution logic

### Framework Integrations
Specialized packages for popular frameworks:

**go_router_guards** - Flutter Go Router integration:
- `GoRouterGuard` specialized for Go Router
- `GuardedRoute` and `UnguardedRoute` mixins for type-safe routes  
- `RouteGuardUtils` for traditional GoRoute usage
- `ConditionalGuard` for path-based protection

**Future integrations** may include other routing systems.

## How It Works

Guards operate using a middleware pattern where each guard can:

1. **Allow** navigation by calling `resolver.next()`
2. **Redirect** navigation by calling `resolver.redirect('/path')`
3. **Block** navigation by calling `resolver.block()`

```dart
class AuthGuard extends GoRouterGuard {
  @override
  FutureOr<void> onGoRouterNavigation(
    NavigationResolver resolver,
    BuildContext context,
    GoRouterState state,
  ) async {
    final isAuthenticated = await checkAuth();
    if (isAuthenticated) {
      resolver.next(); // Allow navigation
    } else {
      resolver.redirect('/login'); // Redirect to login
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

Go Router Guards is perfect for:

- **Authentication flows** - Protect routes that require user login
- **Role-based access control** - Restrict access based on user roles
- **Permission systems** - Fine-grained access control
- **Feature flags** - Control access to experimental features
- **A/B testing** - Route users to different experiences
- **Multi-tenant applications** - Tenant-specific route protection
- **Premium features** - Subscription-based access control
