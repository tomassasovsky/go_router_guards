description: The purpose, problems solved, and when to use it
---

go_router_guards provides a middleware‑style guard system built for Go Router.

## Why this package?

- Unified guard model works for both type‑safe and traditional routes.
- Composable pipelines (`guardAll`, `guardAnyOf`, `guardOneOf`) keep logic modular.
- `ConditionalGuard` targets paths without duplicating logic.
- Clear separation of concerns: guards decide, router executes.

## When to use

- Authentication/authorization checks before navigation.
- Feature flags, maintenance mode, or runtime constraints.
- Async rules (API checks, storage reads) that must resolve before continuing.

## When not to use

- Pure view‑only state changes (prefer in‑page logic).
- If your app has no pre‑navigation constraints.
