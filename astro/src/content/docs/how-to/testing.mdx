description: Strategies and examples for testing guards and navigation
---

This guide shows simple patterns to test guards and composed pipelines.

## Unit testing a guard

Focus on `onNavigation` behavior and assert resolver interactions.

```dart
test('AuthGuard redirects when unauthenticated', () async {
  final resolver = _FakeResolver();
  final guard = AuthGuard(isAuthenticated: () async => false);

  await guard.onNavigation(resolver, _ctx, _state);

  expect(resolver.redirectedTo, '/login');
});
```

## Testing composed guards

Wrap guards with `guardAll`, `guardAnyOf`, or `guardOneOf` and assert final outcome using a fake resolver.
